# Components Basics (Coming Next!)

## What You'll Learn

Breaking down our Content Server object viewer into reusable components.

## Preview of Concepts

- Creating custom components
- Passing data with props
- Emitting events to parent components
- Component composition
- Scoped styles

## What We'll Build

We'll take the single-file app from Lesson 1 and break it into:

1. **InfoCard Component** - Reusable card for displaying object information
2. **ObjectForm Component** - Form for editing object details
3. **StatusBadge Component** - Visual status indicator
4. **App Component** - Main component that coordinates everything

## Why Components Matter

Components are Vue's killer feature. They let you:
- Build once, use everywhere
- Break complex UIs into manageable pieces
- Make your code easier to test and maintain
- Share components across projects

This becomes critical when building tools like the Application Analyzer, where you have many reusable pieces (tree views, data tables, filters, etc.)

Once you're comfortable with reactivity, v-model, computed properties, and methods from Lesson 1, you'll be ready to learn components.
