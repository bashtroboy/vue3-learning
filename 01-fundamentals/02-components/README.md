# Components Basics

## What We're Building

The **exact same app** from Lesson 1, but broken into reusable components!

This demonstrates the power of components: you can take a working app and refactor it into modular, reusable pieces without changing the functionality.

## Concepts Learned

1. **Creating Components** - How to define and use components
2. **Props** - Passing data from parent to child
3. **Events (emits)** - Child components communicating back to parent
4. **Component Composition** - Using components inside other components
5. **Template Strings** - Using template literals for component templates

## Components We'll Build

1. **StatusBadge** - Simple component for displaying active/inactive status
2. **ObjectForm** - Form component that emits update events
3. **InfoCard** - Display component that uses StatusBadge
4. **ComputedInfo** - Component with its own computed properties
5. **App** - Main component that coordinates everything

## Files

- `index.html` - Complete app with all components
- `NOTES.md` - Detailed explanations of component concepts

## How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser! Works identically to Lesson 1, but with better code organization.

## Why This Matters

Components are essential for:
- **Reusability** - Build once, use everywhere
- **Maintainability** - Changes in one place affect all uses
- **Testing** - Test components in isolation
- **Collaboration** - Team members can work on different components
- **Scalability** - Build complex UIs from simple pieces

In the Application Analyzer, you'll see components for tree views, data tables, filters, toolbars, and more. Understanding components is critical for working with that codebase.

## Key Takeaway

**Same functionality, better architecture.** That's the power of components.
