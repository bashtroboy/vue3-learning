# Vue 3 Learning Journey

A practical learning repository focused on Vue 3 fundamentals and building real tools for OpenText Content Server consulting work.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Start Here!)
Basic Vue 3 concepts with simple, practical examples
- Reactivity and data binding
- Components and props
- Events and state management
- Basic Composition API

### Phase 2: Composition API Deep Dive
Understanding Vue 3's modern approach
- `ref` vs `reactive`
- Composables (reusable logic)
- Lifecycle hooks
- Advanced patterns

### Phase 3: Real Tools
Building useful Content Server utilities
- **Content Server Node Browser** - Navigate and explore CS nodes
- **WebReports Query Builder** - Visual interface for building queries
- **Application Analyzer Dashboard** - Widgets for analyzing CS applications
- **AI Integration Prototype** - RAG/Claude integration for Seaside.ai

### Phase 4: Migration Patterns
Preparing for Vue 2 → Vue 3 migration
- Common migration scenarios
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Refactoring patterns from Application Analyzer
