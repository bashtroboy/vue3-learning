# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with Your Vue 3 Learning Journey

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

You don't need any special tools to start! For the first lessons, we're using Vue via CDN (Content Delivery Network), so you just need:

1. **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **A text editor** (VS Code recommended, but any will work)
3. **This repository** (you're already here!)

### Step 2: Start with the First Lesson

1. Navigate to: `01-fundamentals/01-hello-vue/`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (just double-click it)
3. Open `index.html` in your text editor alongside
4. Read through `NOTES.md` to understand what's happening

### Step 3: Experiment!

**The best way to learn is by breaking things and fixing them:**

- Change values and see what happens
- Add new fields
- Try to break the reactivity
- Read the error messages in the browser console (F12)

### Step 4: Work Through the Progression

Complete each lesson in order:

```
01-fundamentals/
  ├── 01-hello-vue/       ← START HERE
  ├── 02-components/       (coming next)
  ├── 03-lists-conditionals/
  └── 04-forms/
```

## Recommended Learning Approach

### 1. Read First
- Open the README for the lesson
- Understand what you're building
- Check out the concepts being taught

### 2. Explore the Code
- Open the files in your editor
- Read the comments
- Try to understand each section

### 3. Run It
- Open index.html in your browser
- Interact with the app
- Open DevTools (F12) to see what's happening

### 4. Experiment
- Make small changes
- Break things intentionally
- Fix what you broke
- This is where real learning happens!

### 5. Read the Notes
- After experimenting, read NOTES.md thoroughly
- Compare your understanding with the explanations
- Make sure concepts are clear

### 6. Do the Exercises
- Most lessons include practice exercises
- Try them without looking at solutions first
- It's okay to struggle - that's learning!

## VS Code Setup (Optional but Recommended)

If you're using VS Code, install these extensions:

1. **Volar** (Vue Language Features)
   - Official Vue 3 extension
   - Provides syntax highlighting and IntelliSense

2. **Live Server**
   - Right-click HTML file → "Open with Live Server"
   - Auto-refreshes browser when you save

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck:

1. **Check the Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Error messages are usually very helpful
   - Read them carefully!

2. **Re-read the NOTES.md**
   - The answer is often there

3. **Review the Code Comments**
   - Inline comments explain tricky parts

4. **Google the Error**
   - Include "Vue 3" in your search
   - Stack Overflow is your friend

5. **Experiment More**
   - Sometimes the best way to understand is to try different approaches

## Progress Tracking

Update the main README.md as you complete lessons:

```markdown
## Current Progress

- [x] Fundamentals: First Vue app        ← Check these off!
- [ ] Fundamentals: Component basics
- [ ] Fundamentals: State management
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't rush** - Really understand each concept before moving on
2. **Type, don't copy** - Typing code helps it stick in your brain
3. **Break things** - Seriously, intentionally break code and fix it
4. **Take notes** - Add your own observations to the files
5. **Build something extra** - Apply concepts to your own ideas

## What You'll Build

By the end of this learning journey, you'll have built:

✅ Interactive Vue 3 applications
✅ A Content Server node browser
✅ A WebReports query builder UI
✅ Dashboard widgets for application analysis
✅ An AI integration prototype (Seaside.ai foundation)

And you'll be ready to upgrade the Application Analyzer from Vue 2 to Vue 3!

## Ready to Start?

Head to: **01-fundamentals/01-hello-vue/**

Open `index.html` in your browser and start playing with it!

Remember: The goal isn't to memorize syntax. It's to understand how Vue thinks about reactivity, components, and building interactive UIs.

**Happy learning!** 🚀
